# Ranjith Babu Vennam

I am pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida (GPA: 3.81). Previously, I worked as a Product Data Management Engineer at Xpheno, supporting Daimler Truck Innovation Center India (DTICI), where I managed datasets and ensured data accuracy using SQL and Python. I also leveraged tools like Tableau and Power BI for data visualization.

During my recent AI Data Engineer & QA Analyst Internship at Xnode AI INC, I focused on automated report generation and data analysis, improving product accuracy and efficiency. I also performed QA testing and market research.

I am involved in research under Ehsan Professor Sheybani, analyzing healthcare data, particularly Length of Stay (LOS) and Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG), to improve hospital management. My technical skills include Python, SQL, and data visualization.

My interests include data visualization, machine learning, and healthcare analytics.
