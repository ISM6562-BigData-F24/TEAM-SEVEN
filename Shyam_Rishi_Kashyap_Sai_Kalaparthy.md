# Shyam Rishi Kashyap Sai Kalaparthy


I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida, specializing in Business Intelligence and Modeling. I have experience as a Software Data Engineer at _VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions), where I optimized ETL workflows and conducted performance analysis of SQL queries. I am skilled in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
